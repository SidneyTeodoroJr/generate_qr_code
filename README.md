# Generate QR Code
 
 This script allows a user to create a QR code (Quick Response Code) easily. A QR code is a type of two-dimensional barcode that can store a large amount of information in a small image that can be read by mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.
 
 The generated QR code image can be saved as an image file or directly shared with others. When a mobile device with a QR code reader reads the image, it can decode the information contained in the code and act on it, such as opening a website, sending an email or playing a video.
